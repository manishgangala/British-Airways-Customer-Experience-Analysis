# British Airways Customer Experience Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer review data of British Airways to understand
customer satisfaction trends, key service drivers, expectation effects across
seat types, and operational improvement opportunities.

The analysis is presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard designed
to support data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.

## Business Problem
Although overall customer satisfaction with British Airways is relatively high,
a gradual decline in ratings over time raises concerns about emerging experience gaps.
This project aims to identify the underlying factors contributing to this trend.

## Datasets Used
- **ba_reviews.csv** – Raw customer reviews and ratings
- **countries.csv** – Country reference data
- **ba_reviews_cleaned.csv** – Cleaned and processed dataset used for analysis

Each row in the review dataset represents one customer's feedback.

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data understanding and validation
2. Data cleaning using Python
3. Logical data modeling using Tableau relationships
4. Trend analysis and service impact analysis
5. Expectation-based segmentation by seat type
6. Aircraft-level operational insights
7. Interactive dashboard creation in Tableau Public
